# ETPLoc

In this work, we propose ETPloc, an efficient deep learning tool that integrates a novel linear attention mechanism for efficiently and effectively acquiring discriminative representations from IHC images, a hierarchical multi-scale architecture  to preserve both fine-grained subcellular patterns and global spatial context, and an enhanced  multi-label objective function to counteract dataset imbalance. By jointly optimizing representation  learning and class distribution modeling, ETPloc overcomes the limitations of existing patch-based  or downsampling-reliant approaches.

## 3. How to Test

### 3.1 Check the data annotation file in the data folder

There should exist four .csv file in `data` folder mentioned in Section 2.1

- If the file starting with `data_` is missing, please download it at <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10632698>
- If the file starting with `HPA18_` is missing, please contact the corresponding author's email address for access: `kooyang@aliyun.com`

### 3.2 Download the images from HPA.

You can get the original image needed for this file in two ways:

1. (Recommand) Download from < https://pan.baidu.com/s/1W8LA4P8uIW2SKcZ3sJuQaw>, the password is `rkjb`. **"IHC"** folder includes the image of Vislocas dataset, and **"HPA18"** folder includes the image of HPA18 dataset. If the website does not work, you can contact the corresponding author for the original image.
2. Download the original image via the `URL` column within the data annotation file

### 3.3 Install the environment.

Before you start, we recommend that you install the python environment management tool `Anaconda`. Afterwards, go to the project root environment in the console interface and execute the command  `conda env create -f environment.yml`

### 3.4 Start to Test

- When you need to test the entire dataset, run the `test.sh` file in the root directory.
- When you need to quickly test the effectiveness of the model predictions, you can run `test_demo.sh` to get test results for a single image. In this step, you can test the effect of ETPLoc trained on different datasets by adjusting the following parameters:

| Parameters        | default                              | Descriptrion                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dataset           | IHC                                  | determines which dataset profile will be used                                     |
| single_image_path | ./assets/Cytopl;Mito/55449_A_1_2.jpg | determines the relative path of the test image, only takes effect in test_demo.py |
